## Usage

Each module is represented as a folder in the [src](https://github.com/zmjlucas/simple-latex-util/tree/master/src/) directory, where the `.sty` file is the actual package file you want to include into your `.tex` file.

You can also check the `.example.tex` file for example usage and the image file for its outcome.
